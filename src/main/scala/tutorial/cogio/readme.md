#Cogio Tutorial Examples

This directory contains sample programs that use APIs from [cct-io](https://github.com/hpe-cct/cct-io) for getting external data into a CCT compute graph.  External data is fed into a compute graph via sensors. Some of the external data sources demonstrated here are:

+ read mpeg files in color or grayscale
+ read frames from a webcam
+ read images in jpg format
